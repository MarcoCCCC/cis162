        <h2>My hobby</h2>
    <p> Ive played video games for as long as i can remember, i played so much that i got exposed to competing for money cause i was good at it. I then started to compete for money agaisnt other players which then expanded to me playing tournaments. Back in 2019 is when i was mainly competeing and at a very high level at that. I was playing in this tournament to qualify for a $30 million dollar prize pool tournament. The cut off to get into this tournament was a weekly tournament for ten weeks where two players would be able to get in each week. I tried and tried but i was short and got a few top tens and one top 4. This being top 4 out of millions of players due to how easy it is to partake in these tourneys. The most i made in one tournament which was that 4th place tournament was $2,000 dollars. This picture is from an interview a year before when i had qualified for one of the first big tournaments for this game which was for $3 million dollar prize pool when i was just starting out. </p>
