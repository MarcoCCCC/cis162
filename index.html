    <h2>My Education Goals</h2>
    <p>I am taking this class to satisfy my assoicates degree in programming and hoping to get a good understanding of html. Honestly a few days ago i had no idea what html or css was which i still dont know but for css but for html i had no idea it was the backbone of websites. I have always wanted to make my own websites and hope i can make them or understand how to after this class. I aspire to have a career with something to do with programming and very intrigued to learn more.</p>
